Introduction
============

Welcome to Programming
----------------------

I love programming. I enjoy the challenge to not only make a working
program, but to do so with style. Programming is like poetry. It conveys
a message, not only to the computer, but to those who modify and use
your program. With a program, you build your own world with your own
rules. You create your world according to your conception of both the
problem and the solution. Masterful programmers create worlds with
programs that are clear and succinct, much like a poem or essay.

One of the greatest programmers, Donald Knuth, describes programming not
as telling a computer how to do something, but telling a person how they
would instruct a computer to do something. The point is that programs
are meant to be read by people, not just computers. Your programs will
be modified and updated by others long after you move on to other
projects. Thus, programming is not as much about communicating to a
computer as it is communicating to those who come after you. A
programmer is a problem-solver, a poet, and an instructor all at once.
Your goal is to solve the problem at hand, doing so with balance and
taste, and teach your solution to future programmers. I hope that this
book can teach at least some of the poetry and magic that makes
computing exciting.

Most introductory books on programming frustrate me to no end. At the
end of them you can still ask "how does the computer really work?" and
not have a good answer. They tend to pass over topics that are difficult
even though they are important. I will take you through the difficult
issues because that is the only way to move on to masterful programming.
My goal is to take you from knowing nothing about programming to
understanding how to think, write, and learn like a programmer. You
won't know everything, but you will have a background for how everything
fits together. At the end of this book, you should be able to do the
following:

-  Understand how a program works and interacts with other programs

-  Read other people's programs and learn how they work

-  Learn new programming languages quickly

-  Learn advanced concepts in computer science quickly

I will not teach you everything. Computer science is a massive field,
especially when you combine the theory with the practice of computer
programming. However, I will attempt to get you started on the
foundations so you can easily go wherever you want afterwards.

There is somewhat of a chicken and egg problem in teaching programming,
especially assembly language. There is a lot to learn - it is almost too
much to learn almost at all at once. However, each piece depends on all
the others, which makes learning it a piece at a time difficult.
Therefore, you must be patient with yourself and the computer while
learning to program. If you don't understand something the first time,
reread it. If you still don't understand it, it is sometimes best to
take it by faith and come back to it later. Often after more exposure to
programming the ideas will make more sense. Don't get discouraged. It's
a long climb, but very worthwhile.

At the end of each chapter are three sets of review exercises. The first
set is more or less regurgitation - they check to see if can you give
back what you learned in the chapter. The second set contains
application questions - they check to see if you can apply what you
learned to solve problems. The final set is to see if you are capable of
broadening your horizons. Some of these questions may not be answerable
until later in the book, but they give you some things to think about.
Other questions require some research into outside sources to discover
the answer. Still others require you to simply analyze your options and
explain a best solution. Many of the questions don't have right or wrong
answers, but that doesn't mean they are unimportant. Learning the issues
involved in programming, learning how to research answers, and learning
how to look ahead are all a major part of a programmer's work.

If you have problems that you just can't get past, there is a mailing
list for this book where readers can discuss and get help with what they
are reading. The address is ``pgubook-readers@nongnu.org``. This mailing
list is open for any type of question or discussion along the lines of
this book. You can subscribe to this list by going to

If you are thinking of using this book for a class on computer
programming but do not have access to Linux computers for your students,
I highly suggest you try to find help from the K-12 Linux Project. Their
website is at http://www.k12linux.org/ and they have a helpful and
responsive mailing list available.

Your Tools
----------

This book teaches assembly language for the **MIPS** processor, run on
the **spimulator** simulator — a fork of James Larus's *spim*. What I
intend to show you is more about programming in general, and about how a
computer and its operating system really work, than about any one chip
or tool set; but standardizing on one keeps the task manageable, and
spimulator keeps it simple.

We chose MIPS and a simulator deliberately. MIPS is a clean, regular
instruction set, designed for teaching, without the decades of special
cases that a chip like the x86 has accumulated. And because spimulator
*simulates* the processor in software, you do not need any particular
hardware or operating system to follow along: spimulator runs on Linux,
macOS, and Windows. You hand it an assembly-source file and it
assembles and runs the program for you, behaving — from the shell's
point of view — like any other program. It reads standard input, writes
standard output, opens files, takes command-line arguments, and returns
a status code the shell can read with ``$?``.

To follow along, install spimulator (see the project's build
instructions), and confirm it runs::

   spimulator -f some-program.asm

That single command assembles and runs the program — there is no
separate compile, link, and run cycle to manage.

Even though spimulator is a simulator, the skills are real and
transferable. The way a program asks the operating system for a service,
manages a stack, lays out records in memory, and hands a status back to
the shell is the same idea on every system — only the spellings change.

Assembly programming lives right at the boundary between a program and
the operating system, so it helps to know what an operating system is.
At its core is the *kernel*. The kernel is the core part of an operating
system that keeps track of everything — on a real machine it is a program
such as Linux (the kernel of the GNU/Linux system, modeled after UNIX).
spimulator plays this role itself: it emulates a tiny operating system,
answering the ``syscall`` instruction with the services listed in
:ref:`syscallap`. The kernel is both a
fence and a gate. As a gate, it allows programs to access hardware in a
uniform way. Without the kernel, you would have to write programs to
deal with every device model ever made. The kernel handles all
device-specific interactions so you don't have to. It also handles file
access and interaction between processes. For example, when you type,
your typing goes through several programs before it hits your editor.
First, the kernel is what handles your hardware, so it is the first to
receive notice about the key press. The keyboard sends in *scancodes* to
the kernel, which then converts them to the actual letters, numbers, and
symbols they represent. If you are using a windowing system (like
Microsoft Windows or the X Window System), then the windowing system
reads the key press from the kernel, and delivers it to whatever program
is currently in focus on the user's display.

::

   Keyboard -> Kernel -> Windowing system -> Application program

The kernel also controls the flow of information between programs. The
kernel is a program's gate to the world around it. Every time that data
moves between processes, the kernel controls the messaging. In our
keyboard example above, the kernel would have to be involved for the
windowing system to communicate the key press to the application program.

As a fence, the kernel prevents programs from accidentally overwriting
each other's data and from accessing files and devices that they don't
have permission to. It limits the amount of damage a poorly-written
program can do to other running programs.

In our case, the role of the kernel is played by spimulator, which
provides the same kinds of services — reading input, writing output,
opening files, ending the program with a status — through its
``syscall`` interface. On a real machine the kernel (such as Linux)
does this for actual hardware; spimulator does it in software, which is
exactly what lets you learn the ideas without a particular operating
system underneath you.

For the most part, this book will be using the computer's low-level
assembly language. There are essentially three kinds of languages:

Machine Language
   This is what the computer actually sees and deals with. Every command
   the computer sees is given as a number or sequence of numbers.

Assembly Language
   This is the same as machine language, except the command numbers have
   been replaced by letter sequences which are easier to memorize. Other
   small things are done to make it easier as well.

High-Level Language
   High-level languages are there to make programming easier. Assembly
   language requires you to work with the machine itself. High-level
   languages allow you to describe the program in a more natural
   language. A single command in a high-level language usually is
   equivalent to several commands in an assembly language.

In this book we will learn assembly language, although we will cover a
bit of high-level languages. Hopefully by learning assembly language,
your understanding of how programming and computers work will put you a
step ahead.
